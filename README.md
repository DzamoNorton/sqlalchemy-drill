# Apache Drill dialect for SQLAlchemy.
---
The primary purpose of this is to have a working dialect for Apache Drill that can be used with Apache Superset.

https://superset.incubator.apache.org

Obviously, a working, robust dialect for Drill serves other purposes as well, but most of the iterative planning for this REPO will be based on working with Caravel. Other changes will gladly be incorporated, as long as it doesn't hurt Superset integration. 

## Current Status/Development Approach
Currently we can connect to drill, and issue queries for basic visualizations and get results. We also ennumerate table columns for some times of tables. Here are things that are working as some larger issues to work out. (Individual issues are tracked under issues)

* Connection to Drill via the databases tab in Superset succeeeds
  * Table lists in the connection for some reason only show the first two qualifiers of drill tables.  So if in the schema dfs.root you have two tables, table1 and table2, instead of showing table1 and table2 or dfs.root.table1 and dfs.root.table2, it will just show dfs.root and dfs.root.  This is tracked in issue: https://github.com/JohnOmernik/sqlalchemy-drill/issues/3
* You can add tables under the tables menu
  * Columns are listed properly from the table - 
* You can do basic queries for certain types of viz/tables
  * More advanced queries/joins appear to have issues. As you learn about new ones, please track in issues

So, we are "limping along" and working as is, but contribution and just testing/use to identify issues would be very welcome! 


### Many thanks
to drillpy and pydrill for code used increating the drilldbapi.py code for connecting!

# NOTE PLEASE READ
Much of the this readme is wrong right now. I need to do updates
Right now all you need to do is python3 setup.py install this on the box you will be runnign super set on then create a URL that looks like this:

drill+sadrill://username:password@drillhost:drillport/dfs/yourdb?use_ssl=True




### Docker 
Get the superset repo and then in
```
FROM supersetimage(not sure it's name)
RUN git clone https://github.com/JohnOmernik/sqlalchemy-drill && cd sqlalchemy-drill && python3 setup.py install 
CMD["superset"]
```
